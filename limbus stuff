Limbus Company operates as a mysterious, low-budget "extraction" firm in The City, specializing in delving into hazardous Ruins to recover Golden Boughs—powerful, reality-warping relics that can grant wishes but often corrupt their wielders. The company recruits the Sinners (convicts with unique literary identities) for these high-risk missions, using a sentient bus named Mephistopheles as their mobile base. Under the guidance of Executive Manager Dante (the player, an amnesiac with a clock head), the group navigates moral dilemmas, corporate intrigue, and monstrous threats. In gameplay, players engage in strategic combat involving "Identities" (alternate personas for Sinners) and "E.G.O." gear (manifestations of their psyches), while unraveling the Sinners' backstories through chapters focused on themes like envy, wrath, and sloth.
Vergilius: The stern, gray-suited "Guide" a color fixer with the title "red gaze" hired by Limbus Company. A former high-ranking member of a powerful Wing (corporate entity), he's tasked with escorting the Sinners through the Ruins. Charismatic yet ruthless, he wields a heated gladus and embodies themes of guidance and damnation, drawing from Virgil in The Divine Comedy. He's pragmatic, often clashing with Dante over methods.
Charon: The diminutive, elderly bus driver with a no-nonsense attitude and a love for sweets. She pilots Mephistopheles and provides cryptic wisdom, occasionally intervening in combat with her oar-like weapon. Inspired by the mythical ferryman of the underworld, she's loyal but enigmatic, hinting at deeper ties to The City's underbelly.
The 12 Sinners are condemned souls with fragmented memories, each modeled after a literary figure. They represent the Seven Deadly Sins (and their virtues) across the game's chapters, using "Identities" to adapt in battle.
